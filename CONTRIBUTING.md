# Contributing to PayLockr

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PayLockr as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/jainsaiyam497s-projects/paylockr/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jainsaiyam497s-projects/paylockr/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jainsaiyam497s-projects/paylockr.git
   cd paylockr/"Prototype 4"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your API keys
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Start backend service (optional)**
   ```bash
   start-backend.bat
   ```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test on multiple browsers if UI changes are made

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Open an issue with the `enhancement` label
3. Describe the feature in detail
4. Explain why it would be useful
5. Consider implementing it yourself!
